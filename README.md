# Cross Platform AutoCue

I created this while on placement at univeristy.

Its a simple web app that has the most common features of an autocue/teleprompter.

## Instructions

### Getting Started
If you just want to use it, download the release for your system.

It is packaged with node-webkit , so if the chrome browser works on you system, so will this.


## Modification

You are free to add/remove any features you want.

Please always point back to this app.


## Feature suggestion / Issues

Support is limited for this app, however I will try to help.

Feel free to suggest features that could be added.
